# 🏨 Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellations Using Machine Learning
### A Comparative Analysis of Random Forest and Neural Networks

## 📄 Project Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking data to build predictive models that can forecast whether a reservation is likely to be canceled. Using machine learning techniques, I compare the performance of a Random Forest classifier and a Neural Network (MLPClassifier) based on accuracy, recall, AUC, and interpretability. The goal is to support better occupancy forecasting, reduce lost revenue, and identify actionable patterns in guest behavior.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify the most influential features driving booking cancellations
- Develop a predictive model that accurately flags high-risk bookings
- Compare performance between interpretable models (Random Forest) and complex models (Neural Network)
- Provide business insights to support hotel revenue management and customer engagement

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python, Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest, MLPClassifier)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is the Hotel Booking Demand dataset from Kaggle:
